This document is meant to serve two purposes. The first is to lay out what can be expected of me as a manager and how i view my role. The second is to act as a written contract, a standard against which i can be held accountable by those around me.
## My Role
Everything i do as a manager revolves around one, central goal: making the team as sustainably productive as it can be. This means that i care about and will do my best to positively effect everything from individual morale to technology choices to process refinement to knowledge-sharing.
## My Values
Like most people i care about a lot of things, but here are the three big ones for me.
### Honesty
I think a work environment where people trust their coworkers is vastly better than the alternative. It means that when advice or guidance is given it can be trusted, that when i give you feedback you can rest assured that i am not hiding anything and that when praise is given from anyone to anyone that esteem is heartfelt and genuine.
### Compassion
We're all in this together, one team that shares responsibilities, burdens, knowledge, failures and successes, and i expect everyone to behave accordingly. I believe that a healthy team is one where everyone cooperates rather than competes, where coworkers are allies rather than threats, and where people feel safe expressing curiosity, asking questions and voicing concerns. 
### Growth
It may be unpleasant in the moment but being challenged, being pushed outside my area of expertise and being forced to learn or refine has always made me a better engineer, and possibly a better person overall. I think one of the best ways to grow is to have people around who will ask questions you don't immediately know how to answer, who will give you tasks that stretch your abilities and who will introduce you to things outside your experience. 
## Expectations
Outside of what i take for granted as the most basic aspects of professional, mature behavior, there are a couple of things i expect from myself and the other engineers on my team.
### Diligence
Engineers should apply thought, consideration and care to every task they undertake. This can on all kinds of forms but for myself it means doing things like running code before submitting a PR, re-reading anything intended for audience of size greater than 0 and avoiding distractions during meetings. The goal here isn't perfection but simply taking care in what we do.
### Honest Effort
There is of course nothing wrong with not knowing the answer to any given question or not being able to accomplish certain tasks, and espressing that lack of knowledge should never be a source of shame or embarrassment, but before relying on those around us we should first make an effort to find our own answers or solve our own problems. This is a double-win: not only do we grow our knowledge and abilities, we respect the time and attention of those around us. 

For myself i usually strive for 15-20 minutes of trying to figure things out on my own and if i make absolutely no progress at all or have no idea where to look or what to try next only then will i reach out for help from others. 
## Our One-on-Ones
These are confidential meetings that exist at least as much for your benefit as mine. Feel free to add items to the agenda and suggest a cadence that works best for you, though initially they're likely to be weekly sessions roughly 30 minutes long. This is a space for you to share with me anything relevant to your career goals, unmet work-related needs, interpersonal issues, etc. 

Unless i feel there is actual risk to you or others everything you share in our 1:1s will stay between the two of us. My aspiration is for you to feel completely safe telling me anything relevant that's on your mind and if that's not the case don't hesitate to inform _my_ boss of that fact.
