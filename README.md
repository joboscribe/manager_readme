This document is meant to serve two purposes. The first is to give you a way to learn what can be expected of me as a manager and how i view my role. The second is to act as a written contract, a standard against which i can be held accountable.
## My Role
Everything i do as a manager revolves around one, central goal: making the team as sustainably productive as it can be. This means that i care about and will do my best to positively effect everything from individual morale to technology choices to process refinement to knowledge-sharing.
## My Values
Like most people i care about a lot of things, but here are the three big ones for me.
### Honesty
I think a work environment wherein people can trust their coworkers is vastly better than the alternative. It means that when someone asks for help it's because they need help it means they are truly stumped and not simply offloading work, that when i give you feedback you can rest assured that i am not hiding anything and that when praise is given from anyone to anyone that esteem is heartfelt and genuine.
### Compassion
We're all in this together, one team that shares responsibilities, burdens, knowledge, failures and successes, and i expect everyone to behave accordingly. I believe that a healthy team is one where everyone cooperates rather than competes, where coworkers are allies rather than threats, and where people feel safe expressing curiosity, asking questions and voicing concerns. 
### Growth
It may be unpleasant in the moment but being challenged, being pushed outside my area of expertise and being forced to learn or refine has always made me a better engineer, and possibly a better person overall. I think one of the best ways to grow is to have people around who will ask questions you don't immediately know how to answer, who will give you tasks that stretch your abilities and who will introduce you to things outside your experience. 
## Expectations
### Due Diligence
### Honest Effort
## Our One-on-Ones
These are confidential meetings that exist at least as much for your benefit as mine. Feel free to add items to the agenda and suggest a cadence that works best for you, though initially they're likely to be weekly sessions roughly 30 minutes long. This is a space for you to share with me anything relevant to your career goals, unmet work-related needs, interpersonal issues, etc. 

Unless i feel there is actual risk to you or others everything you share in our 1:1s will stay between the two of us. My aspiration is for you to feel completely safe telling me anything relevant that's on your mind and if that's not the case don't hesitate to inform _my_ boss of that fact.
